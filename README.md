# NecroLens

![image](icon.png)

This Plugin allows you to explore a DeepDungeon with a tool like the HoloLens or GoogleGlass on.
You will be able to see trough walls, see where monster are looking ore be aware of you and many more.

This is an ESP hack (extrasensory perception), so don't use it if you not feel well.

## Installation
For installation instructions, please see my [custom plugin repo](https://github.com/Jukkales/DalamudPlugins).

   - Sight mobs wil have a 90Â° view in front and agro you once they see you in this area
   - Sound mobs are like proximity mobs, but they only aggro you if you run ner to them or touch them
